The `MsBackendMassbank` package provides functionality to import and handle
MS/MS spectrum data from [Massbank](https://github.com/MassBank/MassBank-data) files.
The package defines the `MsBackendMassbank` backend which can be used to
import and use MS2 spectrum data from mgf files with the
[Spectra](https://github.com/rformassspectrometry/Spectra) R package.
